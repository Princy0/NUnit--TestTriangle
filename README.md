# Project Name - NUNIT - Test Triangle

## Project Description
This project aims to demonstrate the implementation of unit testing for a software application using popular unit testing frameworks, such as JUnit for Java, NUnit for .NET, or pytest for Python. Unit testing is an essential practice in software development that involves testing individual units of code in isolation to ensure their correctness and robustness.

## Features
- Implementation of unit tests for various components of the application.
- Coverage analysis using code coverage tools, such as JaCoCo for Java, OpenCover for .NET, or coverage.py for Python.
- Test automation using build tools, such as Maven for Java, MSBuild for .NET, or pytest for Python.
- Continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) integration with popular CI/CD platforms, such as Jenkins, Travis CI, or CircleCI.
- Test reporting and documentation for easy understanding and maintenance of the tests.

## Technologies Used
- Programming language: C#
- Unit testing framework: NUnit
- Code coverage tool: Visual Studio
- Build tool : MSBuild

## Getting Started
These instructions will help you set up and run the unit tests locally on your development environment.

### Prerequisites
- C# and NUnit installed on your local machine.
- Visual Studio for code coverage analysis.

### Installation
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
```
git clone https://github.com/Princy0/repo.git
```
2. Install the dependencies required for running the tests, if any.
```
dotnet add package NUnit
```
3. Run the unit tests using the build tool.
```
dotnet test MyProject.Tests/MyProject.Tests.csproj
```
5. Review the test results and code coverage report to ensure the correctness and robustness of the application.

## Usage
- Here are instructions on how to use NUnit for unit testing in your .NET project:

1. Install NUnit: First, you need to install NUnit. You can do this via NuGet, the package manager for .NET projects, or by downloading the NUnit framework from the NUnit website (https://nunit.org/).

2. Create test project: Create a separate test project in your solution to house your NUnit tests. This project should reference the main project that you want to test.

3. Write test methods: In your test project, create test methods using NUnit's attributes, such as `[Test]` or `[TestCase]`, to mark them as test methods. These methods will contain the actual test code. You can write multiple test methods to cover different scenarios and use cases.

4. Configure test settings: NUnit allows you to configure various settings for your tests, such as test categories, test order, timeout, and more. You can configure these settings using attributes like `[Category]`, `[Order]`, and `[Timeout]` on your test methods or at the assembly, namespace, or class level.

5. Use test data: NUnit provides various ways to pass test data to your test methods, such as using the `[TestCase]` attribute with inline or external data sources, or using data-driven tests with the `[TestCaseSource]` attribute. You can use these data sources to provide different inputs and expected outputs for your tests, covering different scenarios.

6. Run tests: Use the NUnit test runner to discover and run your tests. You can run tests using the NUnit Test Adapter in Visual Studio, the NUnit console runner, or other test runners that support NUnit. You can also integrate NUnit tests into your build process using a build tool like MSBuild or a continuous integration (CI) tool.

7. Review test results: After running the tests, review the test results to see which tests passed, failed, or were skipped. NUnit provides detailed test results, including stack traces for failed tests, which can help you identify and fix issues in your code.

8. Refactor and iterate: Use the test results to guide your development process. If a test fails, fix the issue in your code and rerun the tests to verify the fix. Refactor your code as needed, and continue to iterate the process of writing tests, running tests, and fixing issues until your code meets the desired quality and functionality.
